      Hi there ðŸ‘‹
      <br /><br />
      Iâ€™m a front-end developer && high school student living in Japan. I have interest in algorithms which are not
      related to competitive programming such as hash, compression, cryptographic algorithm. Also, Iâ€™m studying SSI
      (Self-sovereign Identity) for my senior thesis in high school. Since I am going to study abroad this year, my
      whole ongoing projects are going to stop from the second half of this year to the first half of the next year.
      <br /><br />
      Iâ€™m currently working as an event management intern at Code for Japan. If you have any question about me/my
      project, feel free to send an email or contact me on Twitter!<br /><br />
