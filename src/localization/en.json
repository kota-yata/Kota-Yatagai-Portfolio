  "intro": "Hi there ðŸ‘‹\nIâ€™m a front-end developer && high school student living in Japan. I have interest in algorithms which are not related to competitive programming such as hash, compression, cryptographic algorithm. Also, Iâ€™m studying SSI (Self-sovereign Identity) for my senior thesis in high school. Since I am going to study abroad this year, my whole ongoing projects are going to stop from the second half of this year to the first half of the next year.\n Iâ€™m currently working as an event management intern at Code for Japan. If you have any question about me/my project, feel free to send an email or contact me on Twitter!\n",
